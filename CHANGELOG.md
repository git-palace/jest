## master

* Fixed a bug when passed an empty `testPathIgnorePatterns`.
* Moved preprocessor cache into the haste cache directory.

## 0.5.0

* Added `--noStackTrace` option to disable stack traces.
* Jest now only works with iojs v2 and up. If you are still using node we
  recommend upgrading to iojs or keep using jest 0.4.0.
* Upgraded to jsdom 6.1.0 and removed all the custom jsdom overwrites.

## <=0.4.0

* See commit history for changes in previous versions of jest.
