exports[`test warns when calling unmock when automocking is disabled 1`] = `
"jest.unmock(\'RegularModule\') was called but automocking is disabled. Remove the unnecessary call to \`jest.unmock\` or enable automocking for this test via \`jest.enableAutomock();\`. This warning is likely a result of a default configuration change in Jest 15.
